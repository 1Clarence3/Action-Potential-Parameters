# Action-Potential-Parameters
The computer takes in a set of action potentials and “sweeps” one of the action potentials the user chooses to measure. By treating the graph as a function in the Cartesian plane and differentiating he graph, I found several parameters corresponding with the action potential such as its minimum (AHP or Afterhyperpolarization), maximum, maximum rising rate, and minimum rising rate points.
